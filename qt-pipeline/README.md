Hereâ€™s a suggested README file description for your program:
LAS Point Cloud Viewer

This is a Python-based point cloud visualization tool for .las files that uses the PyVista and laspy libraries to load, display, and interact with 3D point cloud data. The program allows users to browse folders containing LAS files and view point clouds with various visualization options.
Features

    Folder Selection: Allows the user to select a folder containing .las files via a file dialog.
    3D Visualization: Visualizes point clouds from .las files using PyVista.
    Color by Elevation: Points are colored by elevation (Z-axis) by default, with an option to toggle between elevation-based coloration and uniform blue coloration.
    Navigation: Users can navigate between LAS files using the right and left arrow keys.
    Lighting: Eye-dome lighting is enabled to enhance 3D depth perception in the visualization.
    Keyboard Shortcuts:
        Right Arrow: Switch to the next LAS file.
        Left Arrow: Switch to the previous LAS file.
        T: Toggle between coloring by elevation or setting all points to blue.
